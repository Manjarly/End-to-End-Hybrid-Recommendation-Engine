# End-to-End Hybrid Recommendation Engine
End-to-End Hybrid Movie Recommendation Engine

This project implements a hybrid movie recommender system that combines Collaborative Filtering and Content-Based Filtering to provide personalized movie suggestions. The system is built using Python and leverages the MovieLens 100k dataset.
üåü Features

    Hybrid Approach: Combines SVD-based Collaborative Filtering and TF-IDF-based Content-Based Filtering for robust and accurate recommendations.

    Hyperparameter Tuning: Automatically determines the optimal number of latent factors for the SVD model to maximize precision and prevent overfitting.

    Cold-Start Handling: Dynamically serves content-based recommendations to new users who have no rating history, ensuring immediate utility.

    Performance Benchmarking: Evaluates the final model against Popularity and Random baselines using Precision@10 and Recall@10 metrics.

    Data Visualization: Includes clear visualizations for model evaluation and hyperparameter analysis using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The engine is comprised of three core components:

    Content-Based Filtering: This model recommends items based on their attributes. It calculates the TF-IDF vectors for movie genres and uses cosine similarity to find movies that are similar to a user's known preferences.

    Collaborative Filtering: This model leverages the "wisdom of the crowd" by analyzing the rating patterns of all users. It uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to perform matrix factorization on the user-item ratings matrix, uncovering latent factors that represent user tastes and movie characteristics.

    Hybrid Engine: The final model intelligently blends the recommendations from the two models above. It prioritizes the personalized suggestions from collaborative filtering while using content-based results to supplement the list and handle new users.

üìä Performance & Evaluation

The collaborative filtering model was tuned to find the optimal number of latent factors (n_components). The validation curve below shows how Precision@10 changes with n_components, helping to select the best value that balances model complexity and performance.
Validation Curve for n_components

This graph shows the model's precision peaking at an optimal number of components before performance plateaus, indicating the best trade-off.

The final model was benchmarked against two baseline recommenders. The results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the SVD-based collaborative filtering approach.
Model Performance Comparison

The CF model significantly outperforms both the Random and Popularity baselines in both Precision@10 and Recall@10.
